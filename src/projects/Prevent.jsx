            After carrying out my user interview I was able to better understand
            the pain points, needs and goals of one individual suffering from
            pre-diabetes. After carrying out my competitors analysis, I was not
            overly surprised to find out that my interviewee was not aware of
            any support systems out there for them. As there is not many sites
            out there solely about pre-diabetes, rather just pages within other
            websites. I thought it was important to note that the interviewee
            would find a website or app that provides useful information helpful
            to better manage their condition.

          <p className="sm:text-lg">
            When looking through my peers interviews, I found a similarity of
            ‘concern’ when it comes to food and trusting information they are
            given. Especially if the information is incorrect, or rather they
            can not find the correct information, it can be a fatal matter.
            Similarly in my peers interviews, there’s a need of having a
            trusting site that provides correct information all in one place. I
            made sure to include this within a personas needs, which later
            helped me design the user journeys and page flows, based upon my own
            interview and those of my peers.

          </h1>
          <br />
          <p className="sm:text-lg">
            The aim of the user testing was to find out whether my webapp was
            user friendly and fitted the purpose of the journey. I tested my
            prototype on 3 users to receive fair findings.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="sm:text-lg">
            I found that all 3 users found the overall layout “clear” “very well
            organised” with “obvious buttons”. When all 3 users were asked to
            carry out the ‘Call to action’ buttons of the webapp, they found all
            the CTA’s and carried them out with ease. This was reassuring as it
            meant this page flow was user friendly and easy to understand.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="sm:text-lg">
            Although, I had a few observation findings from the user testing,
            the most prevalent one was the user-ability of some of the
            click-able buttons. For example I found that there was a delay in
            the click when each user pressed the CTA ‘Create account’. Also, for
            the hidden sugars game it was designed to be clicked in a certain
            order, which was quite frustrating to the user. I have since
            realised that this feature needs to me more flexible for users.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h1 className="sm:text-xl font-bold">Responding to user testing</h1>
          <br />
          <p className="sm:text-lg">
            In response to the user testing observation findings, I made the
            changes to two of the click-able links to make the webapp user
            friendly. I quickly changed the ‘Create account’ CTA as the
            transitioning had been unawarely changed to drag rather then click.
            I also added more click-able options for the ‘hidden sugar’ feature,
            as previously the options were linked to a certain order rather then
            all click-able in any order.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="sm:text-lg">
            The only issue that worried me by changing this was users would get
            confused on how many options there are before moving on. So I added
            an instructions to how many options there were.

            The greatest adaptation between the desktop and the mobile is the
            navigation bar. Due to the limited space on the mobile compared to
            the desktop, the navigation bar has been replaced with a pop up

            The header image has been resized to fit appropriately for each
            device. As the desktop is larger, it is more impactful having the
            image large across the page. Whereas, on the mobile, it sits better
            visually having it smaller at the bottom so the text is still
            legible.

            The greatest adaptation between the desktop and the mobile is the
            layout of the title and the image at the top of the article. The two
            column layout suited the desktop version visually better and more
            attractive to the user. But due to the smaller space on the mobile
            it made more sense making it one column going downwards.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="sm:text-lg">
            Similar to the ‘My story’ page, I used a two column layout for the
            desktop which changed to a one column layout for the mobile. The
            main adaptation between the desktop and the mobile is the handling
            of the links to both interactive features. As the features were next
            to each other on the desktop, it was important to have consistency
            across both in terms of layout and positioning. Whereas, on the
            mobile as they were in one column is was more important that they
            were the same size only, as the visual hierarchy across both devices
            are different due to the size difference.
          </p>

          <h1 className="sm:text-xl font-bold">Guess the hidden</h1>
          <br />
          <p className="sm:text-lg">
            The greatest adaptation on the hidden sugars game across both
            devices is the layout. On the desktop the click-able options and in
            three columns, whereas, in the mobile they are only in two. Both
            sizes work and are suited for to their own devices.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p className="sm:text-lg">
            The account bar that can be seen on the desktop would be too big and
            intrusive if kept to the same layout for the mobile. Instead, a pull
            out bar can be found for the mobile, which when pulled out, shows
            the same layout to the desktop (shown below). This provides
            flexibility for the user, and makes sure that every element on the
            page is not disfigured to make sure it fits at the smaller size.
